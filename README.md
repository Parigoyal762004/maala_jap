# Mala Jap - Digital Solution

Yesterday, an astrologer recommended I perform a **Mala Jap** for a certain mantra. However, I didn’t have a physical mala on hand, and after searching online for a digital alternative, I couldn’t find anything that suited my needs. So, I decided to create my own solution! Below are the details of the functionality I built to address this need:

## Features & Functionalities:
1. **Interactive Counter**: 
   - A digital counter to help track the number of mantras chanted.
   - The counter increases automatically (set to 108 times by default) or through user interaction (with a button click).
   
2. **Affirmation Input**: 
   - Users can input their personal affirmation or mantra.
   - This input can be used in conjunction with the counter for personalized use.

3. **Mantra Dropdown**:
   - A dropdown menu is available with a list of common Hindu mantras in Sanskrit.
   - Each mantra is associated with its respective deity, providing context for the mantra being recited.
   - Users can select a mantra from the dropdown, making it easy to choose and follow along.

4. ** Self-audio Playback**: 
   - The application allows users to recod mantra.
   - An audio player is integrated into the app, so users can chant along with the mantra while the counter tracks their progress.
    

5. **Visual Design**: 
   - The design incorporates vibrant gradients in the background (yellow, red, orange) to create a spiritual and uplifting atmosphere.
   - Buttons and dropdown menus are designed for ease of use, providing an intuitive interface.
   
6. **Mobile Responsiveness**: 
   - The interface is responsive, ensuring that it works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

7. **Footer**: 
   - A witty footer is added at the bottom of the page: "Made with ❤️ by Pari Goyal @2025. 'Coding, Coffee, and a lot of Karma!'"



This is the essence of the application I built, allowing anyone to perform **Mala Jap** virtually without the need for a physical mala. The audio functionality enhances the experience, making it possible to chant along with the mantra while tracking progress digitally. I hope it helps others who find themselves in the same situation!
